# SQL Query Assistant

## Overview
SQL Query Assistant is an intelligent chat-based tool designed to interpret natural language queries, convert them into optimized SQL queries, and fetch relevant data from an SQLite database. This project utilizes **Llama LLM** and is built using the **Streamlit** framework for an interactive user experience. 🤖💬

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts user queries into SQL commands. 🔄
- **Data Interpretation**: Analyzes structured table data. 📊
- **Efficient Query Execution**: Runs optimized SQL queries in an SQLite database. ⚡
- **Formatted Results**: Presents data in a structured and readable format. 📝
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides insights into generated SQL queries and their execution results. 🧑‍💻

## Technologies Used
- **Llama LLM**: For natural language understanding and query conversion. 🦙
- **Streamlit**: For building an interactive and user-friendly web interface. 🌐
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database to store and retrieve data efficiently. 🗃️
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and logic. 🐍
